# TaxAdda Frontend Assignment

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small test assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed. Also, we request you to write your own code rather than copy assignment from any other source as we can easily determine originality while reviewing all internship application.

## The assignment

We would like you to create a small application with the following features
## First Page - Add GSTIN
- [ ] You have to create a page where user can add below mentioned GSTIN in the application.
- [ ] There will be another option in this page to associate one or more Tag with the added GSTIN. User will be able to add new Tag and edit Old Tag if we want. If user create a new tag then the Tag listing should get updated and the new tag should be visible in the list.
## Second Page - Listing of GSTIN
- [ ] In this page, user will be able to see all the added GSTIN in his account.
- [ ] Also, user will be able to search any GSTIN.
- [ ] User will be able to delete any GSTIN using the delete option on the listing page.
- [ ] Option of select number of GSTIN listing in a page like 5,10, 25 and 50.

## Few extra things which you have to do
- [ ] Make sure you have single component for Add Tag and Delete GSTIN modal. You have to use Props to match the requirement but must have a single component which you should import in the both the pages.
- [ ] No duplication of API’s as we have single API for listing and searching.
